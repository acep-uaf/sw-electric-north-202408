# `src/`

## `main.sh`
Although not located in `src/`, it's worth talking about here for context. Running `./main.sh` from the root directory will run the pipeline start to finish, executing all scripts in `src/` and overwriting all data in `data/`. 

Pipeline scripts are devided into three different folders, `raw/`, `derived/`, and `final/`, which correspond to increasing levels of cleanliness and organization.
