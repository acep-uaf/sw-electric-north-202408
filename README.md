# Stoatworks Electric North
It has been requested that ACEP update the data sources that feed the Electric North Map. To do so, we would like to output a data schema and format that works seamlessly with the University of Saskatchewan's GIS infrastructure. A GeoDatabase has been provided by Saskatchewan as the current Alaska population layer. Additionally, a test database is created in `data/db/` which is used to populate a postgres instance.
